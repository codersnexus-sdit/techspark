# üõ°Ô∏è Security Implementation Checklist

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Current Strengths)

- [x] Environment variables for all credentials
- [x] JWT authentication with proper expiration
- [x] HTTP-only secure cookies
- [x] Database RLS policies enabled
- [x] Server-side credential validation
- [x] TypeScript for type safety
- [x] Removed sensitive SQL files from repository
- [x] Proper logout mechanism
- [x] Input validation on forms

## üö® HIGH PRIORITY (Implement Immediately)

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on admin login (5 attempts/15min)
- [ ] Add rate limiting to registration endpoint (10/minute)
- [ ] Add general API rate limiting (100 requests/15min)

### Enhanced Input Validation
- [ ] Add server-side input sanitization for all API endpoints
- [ ] Implement XSS protection on all user inputs
- [ ] Add SQL injection prevention (already mostly covered by Supabase)

### Admin Security
- [ ] Add account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Implement session timeout (currently 24h)
- [ ] Add admin activity logging
- [ ] Require strong password policy

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next Sprint)

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Implement security event logging
- [ ] Add failed login attempt tracking
- [ ] Monitor unusual registration patterns
- [ ] Set up alerting for security events

### CSRF Protection
- [ ] Add CSRF tokens to forms
- [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration
- [ ] Add request origin validation

### Database Security
- [ ] Implement database query logging
- [ ] Add participant data encryption for PII
- [ ] Set up database backup encryption

## üîç LOW PRIORITY (Future Enhancements)

### Advanced Security
- [ ] Implement 2FA for admin accounts
- [ ] Add API key authentication for integrations
- [ ] Implement content security policy (CSP)
- [ ] Add security headers middleware

### Compliance
- [ ] GDPR compliance for EU users
- [ ] Data retention policies
- [ ] User data export functionality
- [ ] Right to be forgotten implementation

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT SECURITY

### Production Environment
- [ ] Use HTTPS only (SSL/TLS certificates)
- [ ] Enable security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Set up Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] Implement DDoS protection

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Regular security updates for dependencies
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Container security if using Docker
- [ ] Environment variable encryption

## üìä Security Metrics to Monitor

1. **Failed login attempts per IP**
2. **Registration rate anomalies**
3. **Unusual admin session patterns**
4. **Database query performance**
5. **API response times and errors**

## üîß Quick Wins (Can Implement Today)

1. **Add rate limiting library** (completed ‚úÖ)
2. **Implement input sanitization** (partially completed ‚úÖ)
3. **Add security headers to Next.js config**
4. **Set up basic monitoring with console logs**
5. **Create incident response plan**

## üéØ Security Score Goal

- **Current: 7.5/10**
- **After High Priority: 8.5/10**  
- **After Medium Priority: 9.0/10**
- **After All Items: 9.5/10**
